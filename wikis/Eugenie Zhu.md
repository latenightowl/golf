Week 0
======
4/11 1:15pm - 2:15pm: Set up repo, tested out committing changes. Set up IntelliJ work environment for this project. Accidentally created a merge conflict. 
<br/><br/>
4/15 12:15am - 1:00am: Google how to fix the merge conflict. Fixed the merge conflict by using IntelliJ. Learned markdown in order to type this using this website: https://www.markdowntutorial.com/

Comments: Next week, I'll be focusing on figuring out how to unzip the Violet jar file, analyzing it, and applying it to our UML class diagram application.

Week 1
======
4/15 4:00pm - 4:15pm: Figured out how to unzip the Violet jar file in terminal (jar xf example.jar).
<br/><br/>
4/20 4:45pm - 6:00pm: Read through lab 18 and the internet and try to figure out how to use Canvas properly to start the project. Read through the Violet files to try and understand how to implement the project.
<br/><br/>
4/21 3:00pm - 7:00pm: Read through Su's code and ran his graph editor locally. It's an extension of lab 18. Used Su's graph editor to implement an HTML table button that should represent a class node in a UML class diagram. I also figured out how to use GitHub and how to properly collaborate with others: I created my own branch, we started doing pull requests, etc.
<br/><br/>
Comments: I didn't utilize my resources properly which is why I got extremely frustrated. I realized lab 18 had very clear instructions on how to create HTML tables in a canvas halfway through trying to code it from scratch. Next week, I want to figure out how to add the "properties" box to add text to the class node when you click on the node. I also need to go to office hours to figure out if we're even doing this entire project correctly.

Week 2
======
4/27 3:00pm - 5:00pm: Try to use this tutorial to make the properties sheet: https://w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp. It didn't work. 
<br/><br/>
4/28 6:00pm - 7:00pm: Set up the live site: eugeniezhu.bitbucket.io. Couldn't set up the live site on github, since Su already has a live site and each account can only have one. I tried to fork the repo to mine so that I could set it up on my github, but that didn't work either since Su is the owner of the repo. Finally just decided to copy paste the files into my bit bucket and perhaps update it once a week with our progress.
<br/><br/>
Comments: Busy week and didn't spend as much time as I wanted to on this project. Since a lot of my big projects were due last week, hopefully I'll have more time to tackle this project this week. Really struggling with this project since my JavaScript skills are really weak. Also, since I never got anything to work on my end, I never commit onto the repo, so I couldn't get my 5 commits this week.
