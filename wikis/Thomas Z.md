Week 4
======
05/01/19 9-11:00pm: Fixed formatting in graph editor. Made important steps towards finishing the toolbar.
05/02/19 12-2:00pm: Finished the toolbar for graph editor. To do this, fixed infrastructure and made changes to every single file in the graph editor. The code is now fully capable of supporting new edge and node types, so any additional changes I need to make to the framework are trivial from this point.  
05/05/19 4pm-11:59pm: Added node deletion, added clickable button feedback to the toolbar, added enums for tool types, fixed edge rendering issues, added new kinds of edges, cleaned up code everywhere, made canvas larger and resizable. Removed Button.js.  
05/06/19 12-2am: Last minute bug fixes to code.
